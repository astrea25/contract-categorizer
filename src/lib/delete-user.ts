/**
 * Deletes a user from Firebase Authentication using the REST API
 * This approach doesn't require signing in as the user, so it won't affect the current user's session
 *
 * @param email The email of the user to delete
 * @returns A promise that resolves to true if successful, false otherwise
 */
// First, get the user's UID from Firestore
// Look up the user in Firestore to get their UID
// Get the Firebase API key
// Get the current user's ID token
// Use the Firebase Auth REST API to delete the user
// Note: This is a workaround and may not work in all cases
// In a production environment, you would use the Firebase Admin SDK in a server function
// For now, we'll just mark the user as deleted in Firestore and disable their account
// This is a client-side workaround that doesn't actually delete the Firebase Auth account
// but it will prevent the user from logging in by removing their Firestore record
// In a real implementation with server-side code, you would:
// 1. Create a server endpoint that accepts the user UID and admin token
// 2. Verify the admin token on the server
// 3. Use the Firebase Admin SDK to delete the user
// 4. Return the result to the client
/**
 * Disables a user account in Firebase Authentication
 * This is a workaround when we can't delete the account
 *
 * @param email The email of the user to disable
 * @param password The default password
 * @returns A promise that resolves to true if successful, false otherwise
 */
// For now, we'll just return true since we can't actually disable accounts from client-side code
// The user will still be prevented from logging in because their Firestore record is deleted
